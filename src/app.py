"""
High School Management System API

A super simple FastAPI application that allows students to view and sign up
for extracurricular activities at Mergington High School.
Git branch instructions:
To create and publish a new branch called "accelerate-with-copilot":

    git checkout -b accelerate-with-copilot
    git push -u origin accelerate-with-copilot

These commands create the branch locally and push it to the remote, setting the
upstream so future git push/pull use the same branch.
